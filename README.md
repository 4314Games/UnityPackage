*AI Package*

This project is a .unitpackage that can be used within a unity project to create an game Aimanager that allows the user to make any object Ai Controlled with
set behaviours following a custom A-Star alogrithm.

There is also the ability to use a node placement editor that allows you to place custom nodes within a scene and have ai follow that path.
